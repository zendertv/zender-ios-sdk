 ![Zender TargetId and ChannelId](docs/images/targetId-channelId.png?raw=true "Find your Zender TargetId and ChannelId")

# Sample project
A sample project is provided in this repo [Demo Project](ZenderDemo)

- You'll need your targetId and channelId configured in the ViewController.m
- the project uses Cocoapods , so requires a `pod install` to install all the dependencies

# Usage

# Installation
## Using cocoapods
The sdk is provided via private Cocoapod repository.
Add the following to the top of your Podfile

```
source 'https://github.com/zendertv/Specs.git'`
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
```


Add this pod :
```
 # Pods for ZenderDemo
 pod 'Zender'
```

Note: The pod downloads a large zip file containing the frameworks , this might take some time

## Manual installation

A zip file containing the sdk frameworks can be downloaded from <https://repo.zender.tv/ios/zender-ios-sdk-v2.1.0.zip>

Note: the framework files are large, if you want to check them in you will require github Large File Support

### Add to Embedded Frameworks to the project
The second step is to add the frameworks as embedded frameworks:
- Select your Application Target (on the left)
- Select the General tab
- Select Add the framework via the `Embedded Binaries` (+ button)
- Select Other to add the framework
- Browse to your manually downloaded sdk file
- Add frameworks `Zender`, `ZenderPhenix` and `PhenixSdk`
- When a screen pops up to 'Choose options for adding these files' `(Select Copy if needed)`

![Add to Embedded Frameworks](docs/images/ios/framework-embed.png?raw=true "Add to Embedded Frameworks")

### Basic frameworks
Now add the necessary frameworks under "General/Linked Frameworks and Libraries": 
- UIKit.framework
- JavascriptCore.framework
- AVFoundation.framework
- AVKit.framework

# Additional configuration

### Disable bitcode
Zender depends on frameworks that are currrently not BITCODE enabled.  Therefore you need to disable it:
- Select your Application Target (on the left)
- Select the `Build Settings` tab
- Find `Enable Bitcode` and select NO

![Disable bitcode](docs/images/ios/disable-bitcode.png?raw=true "Disable bitcode")

### Background audio
To be able to play audio in background, add this to the background mode:

- Select your Application Target (on the left)
- Select the `Capabilities` tab
- Select `Audio, Airplay, and Picture in Picture`

![Background Audio](docs/images/ios/background-audio.png?raw=true "Background Audio")

### Orientation Portrait
The Zender player autorotates, if you don't want this behaviour you need to fix the app rotation or the controller

- Select your Application Target (on the left)
- Select the `General` tab
- Select/Deselect the required `Device Orientation` options

![Fix portrait](docs/images/ios/portrait-only.png?raw=true "Fix Portrait Modus")

### UI Fullscreen
On iPad screens can be viewed in split screen , it's best to disable that
![Enable Full screen only](docs/images/ios/full-screen.png?raw=true "Enable Full Screen")

## Strip frameworks
The Zender frameworks provides `armv7, arm64, x86_64` architecture builds.
To publish an app to the appstore, you need to strip the simulator part.

[A sample strip script](scripts/strip-framework.sh)


# Push notifications
The Zender Admin console provides a way to send push notifications to users to notifiy them when new streams are available.
This requires push notification certificate setup to match the bundleId of your app and allowing us to send the push notifications.

## Enable Push notifications in your project/provisioning profile
![Enable Push notifications](docs/images/ios/enable-push-notifications.png?raw=true "Enable Push notifications")


## Sample code
Just add the following part to your `AppDelegate.m`

```objective-c

@import Zender;

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken {
    [[Zender sharedInstance] application:application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:deviceToken];
}
```

# Deeplinking
Zender supports using Universal Deeplinks. The default zender domain is links.zender.tv . To make this work, the AppId needs to be configured in the backend.


## Enable Universal Links
Add `links.zender.tv` under your domains.

![Enable Universal Links](docs/images/ios/enable-universallinks.png?raw=true "Enable Universal links")

## Sample code
Just add the following code so Zender handles the deeplinks

```objective-c
@import Zender;

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application continueUserActivity:(NSUserActivity *)userActivity restorationHandler:(void (^)(NSArray<id<UIUserActivityRestoring>> * _Nullable))restorationHandler {
    
    BOOL handled = [[Zender sharedInstance] handleUniversalLink:userActivity.webpageURL completion:^(NSError *error) {
        
    }];
    
    return handled;
    
}

```
